# Firebase Train Time Tracking Web App

This is a simple test for utalizing a frebase database and moment.js for time tracking the user's input data (a train's arrival time and frequency).

## Instructions
1. The DOM will display previously inputed train times
2. The user can input a train's first arrival time in a day and the frequency that train will return for the rest of the day
3. The DOM will update with train times that are submitted and will include the minutes left until the next arrival from the current time.
